------- Ceramic model implementations/changes ------------------------------------------------------------------------

RameshV2 is a set of files for implementation of the Integrative model within Uintah. 
This integrative model was built as part of the MEDE collaboration effort and includes the mechanism of fracture, amorphization, granular flow. 
This is ideal for modeling brittle ceramics like Boron Carbide.

Folder RameshV2 and Ramesh V3 is to be added to ..../src/CCA/Components/MPM/Materials/ConstitutiveModel

The sub.mk file, ConstitutiveModelFactory.cc is also to be updated in that same place. Infact it just updates the link to the RameshV2 and V3 folder.

the file constitutive_models.xml is to be updated into ..../src/StandAlone/inputs/UPS_SPEC

Updates on changes to UINTAH for brain simulations
Updated by Ahmed Alshareef and Kshitiz Upadhyay

There is a set of files that need to be updated within UINTAH to run the brain simulations. The four main changes are:
1) to be to apply a kinematic boundary condition on only one part, rather than all particles in the model.
2) anisotropic constitutive models that take in a fiber direction and dispersion measure ("FA" value).
3) a new constitutive model - Quasi-linear Viscoelastic, Anisotropic Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden (HGO) model. See (Ganpule et al. 2017 - J. Neurotrauma) and (Gasser et al. 2006 - J .R. Soc. Interface)
4) a new constitutive model - an Isotropic Nonlinear Visco-hyperelastic model. See (Upadhyay et al. 2020 - J. Mech. Phys. Solids)

For change [1] and [2], the following files need to be updated:
 - SingleVelContact.cc  (....\src\CCA\Components\MPM\Materials\Contact)
 - ParticleCreator.cc   (....\src\CCA\Components\MPM\Materials\ParticleCreator)
 - ParticleCreator.h    (....\src\CCA\Components\MPM\Materials\ParticleCreator)
 - MPMFlags.cc          (....\src\CCA\Components\MPM\Core)
 - MPMFlags.h           (....\src\CCA\Components\MPM\Core)
 - SerialMPM.cc         (....\src\CCA\Components\MPM)
 - ConstitutiveModel.cc (....\src\CCA\Components\MPM\Materials\ConstitutiveModel)
 - ConstitutiveModel.h  (....\src\CCA\Components\MPM\Materials\ConstitutiveModel)
 - FileGeometryPiece.cc (....\src\Core\GeometryPiece)
 - FileGeometryPiece.h  (....\src\Core\GeometryPiece)
 - SmoothGeomPiece.cc   (....\src\Core\GeometryPiece)
 - SmoothGeomPiece.h    (....\src\Core\GeometryPiece)
 - MPMLabel.cc          (....\src\CCA\Components\MPM\Core)
 - MPMLabel.h           (....\src\CCA\Components\MPM\Core)
 - Pfs.cc               (....\src\StandAlone\tools\pfs)
 - Pfs2.cc              (....\src\StandAlone\tools\pfs)
 - ImpMPM.cc            (....\src\CCA\Components\MPM)
 - Mpm_spec.xml         (....\src\StandAlone\inputs\UPS_SPEC)
 - Ups_spec.xml         (....\src\StandAlone\inputs\UPS_SPEC)
 
For change [3], the files "HGOC.cc" and "HGOC.h" need to be added to the (..../src/CCA/Components/MPM/Materials/ConstitutiveModel) folder .
For change [4], the files "CompOgUSS.cc" and "CompOgUSS.h", "CompGent.cc and .h", "CompGUSS.cc and .h" need to be added to the "ConstitutiveModel" folder listed above.
  - Both changes also require changes to the "sub.mk" and "ConstitutiveModelFactory.cc" in the same folder to update links and model inputs as described above. 
  - An additional change to the "Constitutive_model.xml" file in (..../src/StandAlone/inputs/UPS_SPEC) folder is also required.
